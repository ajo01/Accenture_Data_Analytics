## The Problem
SocialBuzz is a media company with 100k+ content. Visualize these tasks:

1. How many unique categories are there?

2. How many reactions are there to the most popular category?

3. What was the month with the most posts?


### Dashboard

Used Python for data cleaning, Tableau for data visualization
